Task 3: Bug/Defect Reporting

To raise a defect after a bug has been identified, we proceed as follows: 

1) Give an ID or name the uniquely identifies the bug
2) Give a detailed description or summary of the Bug
3) Give the priority (How soon it should be fixed) and severity (impact on the system) of the Bug.
4) List detailed steps to reproduce the bug
5) Give the test environment on which the bug was noticed
6) Add screenshots and videos where possible
7) Add preliminary diagnoses that you have carried out, console, network tab, logs, time stamps etc. 
8) Give your own thoughts of how you think the buh can be fixed. 



Task 4: API Testing

Create a Postman request to call the below API URL and list down the response
validations you would perform.
GETÂ https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1

Remark: The API endpoint returns a different response everytime with a different structure. What I am able to test for now is: 

1) The response status: That the endpoint returns a response status of 200

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

2) That it returns a JSON schema of type object. 

pm.test("Return a json schema of type object", () => {
    const schema = {
        "type": "object"
    }
    pm.response.to.have.jsonSchema(schema);
})

We could validate the schema further by validating the property types, the value types, required fields, and restricting additional fields. I will limit it here for now since the response and the structure changes everytime.
